ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping

When we work with an object-oriented system, there is a mismatch between
the object model and the relational database. RDBMSs represent data in
a tabular format whereas object-oriented languages, such as Java or C#
represent it as an interconnected graph of objects.

(ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational
databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc.

An ORM system has the following advantages over plain JDBC −

Advantages:
1	Let’s business code access objects rather than DB tables.
2	Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic.
3	No need to deal with the database implementation.
4	Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure.
5	Transaction management and automatic key generation.
6	Fast development of application.
